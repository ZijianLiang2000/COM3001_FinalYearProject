The food is amazing and a really good value too. One another amazing thing about it are the people working there. It's always so busy, but the team never looks flustered or overwhelmed.

Excepting by the birria (lamb), tacos don't taste as they should (specially the cochinita). They should change the name of each taco, otherwise this feels like cultural appropriation. I knew it was a bad signal that the cooks were not even latins, no offense, but there's no way a stranger knows exactly how original mexican food is supposed to taste.\n*Disclaimer: I see many foreigners giving 5 stars, I give it 1 not because the food was awful, but because I as foreigner in London, I looks for good tacos, in mexican standards. Otherwise, I would go to taco bell, chipotle or any of those tasty but fake mexican places.","time":1651762404}]},{"name":"BAO Borough","place_id":"ChIJ2-1WGMwDdkgRxGqNanU9Wys","reviews":[{"author_name":"TJ Sabherwal","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115770285677765632123/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJzdW65GCmsvABoV0c4Zg7gscS299clVt2KXvFGx=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 weeks ago","text":"Food is banging, especially the fried chicken, ox's heart and chilli sauce.  It's best to treat this place as an expensive tapas bar and order a load of dishes to share with a group.  My only gripe is that after ¬£17 on food or just me, I was still hungry.  Whilst quality is 100% there, value for money is around 75%.  That being said, they get 5 stars because the service was fantastic, friendly, quick and the place had its own unique vibe.
