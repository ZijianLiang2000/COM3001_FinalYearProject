There's a wide range of food put out. From chips to Chinese soups. The ice cream isn't bad either. Eat as much as you like, although two plates for me was enough.","time":1646502631},{"author_name":"Julian Cwalinski","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100540334022035742210/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj-CTyutXpmXHcyhx0ivdZs1qlUaBo55UqFdaBPnA=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba6","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"2 months ago","text":"Me and a friend came in here around 8pm on a Saturday evening, we'd been drinking in Camden all day and wanted to eat something to soak up the beer and slow down our further intake for a long enough period for a certain amount of sobriety to return. This place served it's purpose admirably. It was Â£8-80 for all you could eat Chinese food (and half price if your child is below 1.3m).The plentiful food was all delicious and we went around multiple times and had several plates full without wasting any food. We were stuffed and more sober than when we entered the establishment,  we where then able to continue our drinking session until the early hours of the following morning. I highly recommend this place to you.","time":1646600192},{"author_name":"Edilene Marques","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110744671019492422216/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjKO57QrdWj6oTu8zWjakefvBNy9pQmqx4EFIi0qQ=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Good value for money. All you can eat for an affordable price. Nice staff, good food, clean and cheerful.

I was forced thier by a friend as we were passing. The food is lush. The price you can not even dare to complain about. Yet each item of food tastes yummy. Really broke the stigma around buffet food for me. Well worth a try... yum","time":1635915668},{"author_name":"Maribeth Blaza","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116429260704469684807/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJy5BjVqq_NUuJkAoDFBlR3aNpAy1E2OxxHajAau=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba2","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"4 months ago","text":"Beautiful inside.
