We ordered two bowls different noodles, one with spinach handmade because I prefer veg stuff and it was absolutely delicious. One do the best noodles I have ever had. The Murger is also enjoyable but just a bit dry, would be perfect with some sauce in the middle or to dip in.\nDefinitely recommend this place, amazing food and the service is good, our waiter was very nice and helpful. Dishes are also served quite quick!\nWill be going there again soon!!","time":1648939407},{"author_name":"Travis","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114211049299859925647/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjK8AwmsAEqE-EPSd-MIkTAd2n1kZO6QYNipZijqg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The ONLY good thing place was that XI‚ÄôAN Sunset. Service is decent.\n\nHowever I think it‚Äôs just overpriced average food. The noodles are just super long and it gets really messy. My brand new shirt was completely totalled because of the noodles as it kept dropping every time I tried to eat it.\n\nNot worth your money. Just average food.","time":1651198159},{"author_name":"Carol","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/112238737360331029370/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgQtLIUj9xWyk9cPT_NaX1Q48DSU37jFp3IPYNHLD8=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Fresh ingredients, and handmade noodle. Diangdiang Noddle is a must! We tried a couple starters and one bun dish, (Xi'an style), and a noodle dish each. Everything is delicious and freshly made right in front of you. Highly recommended, and a hidden gem on this quiet street.","time":1647876731},{"author_name":"zixuan wei","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109256471499607419834/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJyCTFDe8A4jTTb6iMDK6Y8yuw6c6XbJqJYH2m5q=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"in the last week","text":"There I met the most beautiful Chinese waitress even if I never saw her face under the black face mask. The food was wonderful and traditional. But I cannot really focus on the food from her beauty. I thought thousands of times to ask her WeChat number but I was like a coward without enough confident to say that. If you can read my review, can you please give your Wechat number to me or anyone else can help me to ask and send me in private. I really don‚Äôt want to miss her","time":1651937260},{"author_name":"TimotoSs","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105332082720907100437/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjBcswjiAX4bwasC27zg-PRGgJy2DMSXbUMO-agVg=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba3","rating":5,"relative_time_description":"a week ago","text":"The food was pretty good, the portion sizes were huge, the cost was a little big but still alright.
