Great shop with great prices. It has a dedicated car park on top of its, so you won't need to worry about finding a place to park.

Most of those that were wearing masks had them over their chins and not covering their mouths or noses. There was also a large number of customers not wearing masks yet not challenged by staff. I understand they can be uncomfortable but when there are signs telling everyone to wear masks why do the staff feel it does not apply to them. It's very disappointing  to see this with the way  things are  at the moment, one thing that cheered me up was watching an Asda TV ad telling us how all their staff wear masks and ask customers to do the same.","time":1605639784},{"author_name":"Rebecca Brown","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/109756326294626290270/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AATXAJxcW89j0rzm6ll6fHG6x78fAbc_P6-lIj3qGT0U=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo","rating":4,"relative_time_description":"3 weeks ago","text":"Very lovely man called bamil made our pizza for us today been getting one made every Friday normally for years now and never hand someone as helpful friendly and make us exactly what we have asked for happy to help and with a smile on his face","time":1650122760}]},{"name":"Creams Cafe Bexleyheath","place_id":"ChIJO6w2Sl-u2EcRL44zoSzYINc","reviews":[{"author_name":"Hiresh Mistry","author_url":"https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117544510624077275358/reviews","language":"en","profile_photo_url":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Git_oQ0U2xpEosJ80MfEZjkge8f5Vk1SOTXW7WhV7k=s128-c0x00000000-cc-rp-mo-ba4","rating":1,"relative_time_description":"a month ago","text":"Horrible and incredibly expensive through Uber Eats. Cookie dough came crammed into a plastic container, barley a full portion, covered in way too much white chocolate sauce. It was cold by the time it arrived and didn't even taste nice.
